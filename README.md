- `include`: Header files for the classes.
- `src`: Source code of the classes and their methods.

## Components
- `CFormatter`: Class for formatting XML, supports various modes of character escaping.
- `CStreamTarget`, `CStreamWriter`: Classes for outputting data to different streams (standard output or files).
- `СWriter`, `СWritableObj`, `СWritableObj2`: Classes for creating and managing XML structures.
- `CTag`, `COpenTag`, `CTagValue`, `COpenTagWithAttributes`, `CAttribute`, `CCloseAttributes`, `CCloseTag`: Auxiliary classes for managing XML tags and attributes.

## Getting Started
To use the library, include the header files and compile the source code along with your project.
